Sudoku Puzzle Solver

Enter the puzzle as a series of arguments from left to right top to bottom, using dashes, zeroes, or any other non 1-9 non-whitespace character for empty cells

e.g. ./sudoku {2,0,0,3,4,0,0,.....}

The program will verify the puzzle, solve it, and print the solution

By the definition of Sudoku puzzle, it shouldn't be possible for a puzzle to have multiple or no solutions, but if you input a Sudoku-like puzzle with no solutions, the program will tell you it's unsolvable and terminate, and if you input a Sudoku-like puzzle with multiple solutions, it will find and display one of them
